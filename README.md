# CustomerData_experimentatiom_with_Python_SQL
I wanted to learn how to deal with these workflows. Importing data using python, doing some exploratory data analysis on it, some transformations and then use then use that data to find some insights. SQL was the insight engine I wanted to try. I know SQL well so it was more like a fun practice day out.

📊 Data Analytics Project – Python & SQL
🧾 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python and SQL. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and advanced querying across multiple relational database systems.

The objective of this project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using industry-standard tools and best practices.

📂 Dataset

Structured dataset (CSV format)

Contains numerical, categorical, and date-based features

Used to analyze trends, performance metrics, and key business indicators

The dataset is processed and cleaned before analysis to ensure consistency and accuracy.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

SQL

PostgreSQL

Other Tools

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Git & GitHub

🔎 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas

Inspected data structure and data types

Reviewed dataset size and column information

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics

Identified data distributions

Detected correlations

Analyzed trends and patterns

Identified missing values

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicate records

Standardized column formats

Corrected inconsistent data entries

Created derived/calculated columns when necessary

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Imported cleaned dataset into:

PostgreSQL

Wrote and executed queries using:

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

GROUP BY and Aggregations

JOIN operations

Subqueries and CTEs

Generated key metrics and performance summaries


📈 Results & Insights

Key insights derived from the analysis include:

Identification of top-performing categories

Detection of performance trends over time

Highlighting of anomalies or data inconsistencies

Data-driven recommendations for improvement

This project demonstrates the ability to work across the full data analytics pipeline — from raw data to actionable insights.
