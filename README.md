# CustomerData_experimentatiom_with_Python_SQL
I wanted to learn how to deal with these workflows. Importing data using python, doing some exploratory data analysis on it, some transformations and then use then use that data to find some insights. SQL was the insight engine I wanted to try. I know SQL well so it was more like a fun practice day out.
